# Report on Upskill: JavaScript basics with HTML and CSS

I have spent some time upskilling to contribute to this project. So far, I have learnt the basics of using JavaScript with HTML and CSS. I have completed a 7-hour course online and followed through each chapter of the basics and I understand the basic concepts of working with these languages together for web development.  

The online courses focused mainly on the fundamentals of JavaScript, HTML and CSS.  I have learnt a few important information from this course:

JavaScript basics.

Modifying text styles, text boxes and images using CSS.

Chrome DevTools – tool for debugging and inspecting code.

CSS Box Model – designing and positioning elements on a website. Structure of HTML.
